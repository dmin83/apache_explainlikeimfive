# Apache Explain Like I'm five
This project has been put in place so Apache Software Foundation(ASF) projects can be listed and an easy to understand writeup is written about as many projects that can be covered is put in one place.

The main objective is to make it easy for people to understand Apache Foundation Projects and what that project can be used for. Explain Like I'm five comes from a Sub-Reddit of the same name. It means even if the person reading it were a five year old they should be able to understand what is being written.
